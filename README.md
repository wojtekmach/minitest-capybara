# minitest-capybara

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/minitest-capybara.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/wojtekmach/minitest-capybara)

Capybara matchers support for minitest unit & spec

## Why?

Capybara has good support for RSpec.

If you want to use it with minitest, you can of course write:

```ruby
assert page.has_content?("Hello")
```

but:

1. it's kinda ugly
2. you don't have meaningfull error messages.

With this project minitest gets all the good stuff.

## Usage

See example app: https://github.com/wojtekmach/minitest-capybara-example

Add to Gemfile:

```ruby
# Gemfile
group :test do
  gem "minitest-capybara"
end
```

Next, I like to create seperate test class for acceptance tests.

```ruby
# test/test_helper.rb
require "capybara/rails"

# for just minitest/unit
class AcceptanceTest < Minitest::Unit::TestCase
  include Capybara::DSL
  include Capybara::Assertions

  def teardown
    Capybara.reset_session!
    Capybara.use_default_driver
  end
end

# for minitest/spec
class AcceptanceSpec < AcceptanceTest
  extend Minitest::Spec::DSL
end
```

Finally, you can use it like this:

```ruby
# test/acceptance/home_test.rb
require "test_helper"

class HomeTest < AcceptanceSpec
  it "home test" do
    visit "/"

    assert_content "Homepage"
    page.must_have_content "Homepage"

    within ".login" do
      refute_content "Signed in as"
      page.wont_have_content "Signed in as"
    end

    assert_link "Sign in"
    assert_link find(".login"), "Sign in"
    find(".login").must_have_link("Sign in")

    assert_selector 'li:first', text: "Item 1"
    page.must_have_selector 'li:first', text: "Item 1"
  end
end
```

## Capybara drivers

Switching drivers is easy with [minitest-metadata]:

  [minitest-metadata]: https://github.com/wojtekmach/minitest-metadata

```ruby
require 'minitest-metadata'

class AcceptanceSpec
  before do
    if metadata[:js]
      Capybara.current_driver = Capybara.javascript_driver
    else
      Capybara.current_driver = Capybara.default_driver
    end
  end
end

class HomeTest < AcceptanceSpec
  it "home with ajax", js: true do
    visit "/"
    page.must_have_content "AJAX enabled..."
  end
end
```
